// File: Services/UI/HoverPanelService.qml
// =============================================================================
// Central manager for "open panel on hover" bar widgets.
//
// A bar widget arms the service on hover-enter, passing the panel it wants to
// open plus a callback that performs the actual open. The service delays the
// open so that merely sweeping the cursor across the bar does not flash every
// panel in turn.
//
// Once a panel is open *because of hover*, the service keeps it open while the
// pointer is over either the widget or the panel, and closes it (after a short
// grace period, so the widget -> panel hand-off has time to land) when the
// pointer leaves both. Panels opened by a click are never touched: only the
// hover path arms the close tracking.
//
// Bar widgets and panels live in different windows, so hover state cannot be
// derived from a single MouseArea. Widgets report their own enter/exit, and
// SmartPanel reports the panel side through setPanelHovered().
//
// Functions:
//   arm(options)      - Widget hovered: cancel any pending close, schedule the open
//   disarm(anchor)    - Widget unhovered: schedule the close if we opened the panel
//   setPanelHovered() - Panel hovered: keep the panel open (see SmartPanel)
//   cancel()          - Drop all tracking (used when the panel closes by other means)
//
// Options accepted by arm():
//   screen      - ShellScreen the widget lives on (required)
//   anchor      - Widget item, used to ignore stale enter/exit pairs
//   panel       - PanelService name of the target panel, "" when there is none
//   open        - Callback performing the open (required)
//   trackPointer- false for panels that are not hover-aware (overlay launcher)
