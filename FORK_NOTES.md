# Fork Notes - Agnoctural Shell

This document explains the current state of Agnoctural as an independent fork of Noctalia Shell.

---

## Fork Status

**Agnoctural** is an independent fork of [Noctalia Shell](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell) (v4).

### Timeline

- **Original Noctalia v4** - Maintained by the Noctalia team as a complete QML/Quickshell desktop shell
- **Noctalia v5 Announcement** - Full rewrite in C++ (no longer QML-based), focus shifted to v5 development
- **Noctalia v4 Discontinued** - v4 no longer receives updates; replaced by C++ v5
- **Agnoctural Fork Created** - Forked from Noctalia v4 for independent maintenance and continued QML-based development

---

## Maintenance Approach

### Goals
- ✅ Keep the QML-based shell functional and maintained
- ✅ Maintain MangoWC as the sole supported compositor (via mmsg IPC)
- ✅ Fix bugs and add community-requested features
- ✅ Maintain compatibility with existing configs and themes

### Non-Goals
- ❌ Rewrite in C++ or major architectural changes
- ❌ Compete with Noctalia v5 (different approaches, both valid)
- ❌ Official support or SLAs

### Scope
- Bug fixes for existing functionality
- Compatibility updates for new Wayland compositor features
- Configuration path changes (e.g., `~/.config/agnocturnal/`)
- Rebranding to reflect fork status
- Minor feature additions that fit the shell's scope

### Out of Scope
- Major new subsystems beyond the shell's responsibility
- Support for proprietary compositors or desktop environments
- Guarantees on update frequency or feature roadmap

---

## Configuration Migration

### For Existing Noctalia v4 Users

If you're migrating from Noctalia v4 to Agnoctural, note these changes:

**Old Config Path:**
```
~/.config/noctalia/
~/.cache/noctalia/
```

**New Config Path:**
```
~/.config/agnocturnal/
~/.cache/agnocturnal/
```

**Automatic Path Change:**
- Agnoctural uses `AGNOCTURNAL_CONFIG_DIR` and `AGNOCTURNAL_CACHE_DIR` environment variables
- If not set, defaults to `~/.config/agnocturnal/` and `~/.cache/agnocturnal/`

**Manual Migration:**
1. Copy your existing Noctalia v4 config:
   ```bash
   cp -r ~/.config/noctalia/ ~/.config/agnocturnal/
   cp -r ~/.cache/noctalia/ ~/.cache/agnocturnal/
   ```
2. Update color scheme names in `~/.config/agnocturnal/settings.json`:
   - `"Noctalia (default)"` → `"Agnoctural (default)"`
   - `"Noctalia (legacy)"` → `"Agnoctural (legacy)"`

## Upstream Relationship

**Original Repository:** https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell

This fork does **not** submit pull requests upstream or claim to be the official continuation. It is maintained as an independent project.

**Why not merge back?**
- The Noctalia project has moved to v5 (C++ rewrite)
- The two projects have diverged in goals and maintenance model
- Both approaches are valid; users can choose which fits their needs

---

## Dependency Notes

### Quickshell Dependency

Agnoctural depends on Quickshell (Qt/QML framework) via the `noctalia-qs` fork:
```
https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-qs
```

This is the Quickshell fork maintained for Noctalia v4 compatibility. As long as this Quickshell fork is maintained, Agnoctural can continue running.

**If `noctalia-qs` is unmaintained:**
- The project may need to fork Quickshell as well, or
- Find an alternative QML/Qt Wayland shell framework

---

## Future Directions

### Potential Development Areas
- Bug fixes and stability improvements
- Support for new Wayland compositor features
- UI/UX refinements
- Theme and customization options
- Performance optimizations

### Not Planned
- Major architectural rewrites (C++, Rust, etc.)
- Support for non-Wayland environments
- Desktop environment features (file manager, settings daemon, etc.)
